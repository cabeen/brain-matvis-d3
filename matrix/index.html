This matrix diagram visualizes large-scale white matter connectivity in the human brain.
The connectivity model was derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
tractography as follows.  First, A high-resolution
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging#T1-weighted_MRI">T1 MRI</a>
was parcellated into gray matter regions using 
<a href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">Freesurfer</a>,
then
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractography">streamline fiber tractography</a>
was performed on a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI">diffusion MRI</a>.
Next, fibers beginning and terminating near gray matter areas were
mapped to pairs of regions from the
<a href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CorticalParcellation">Desikan-Killany Atlas</a>,
and a variety of metrics of connectivity
strength were computed from combinations of fiber length and diffusion
indices.  These metrics have been
<a href="http://vis.cs.brown.edu/docs/pdf/g/Correia-2008-QTM.pdf.html">
    found to be especially sensitive to white matter integrity
</a>.
This visualization includes the mean and variance of these connectivity metrics
across a population of 80 normal subjects.
</p>
<p>
Each colored cell represents the value of a connectivity metric between a pair
of gray matter areas, where darkness of a cell is mapped according to the scale
and the metric value.  Scales specify how the connectivity metrics map to cell
color, and the scale can be selected in a list above.  Linear scales preserve
relative differences between metric values but can wash out interesting details
if there are outliers.  Using a logarithmic or exponential scale can give more
emphasis to lower or high values, respectively.  By default, the minimum and
maximum metric values are mapped to the lightest and darkest colors,
respectively.  However, the slider above can be used to adjust the range of
this mapping.  Scales that begin "inv" will reverse the orientation of the
mapping (making smaller values darker and bigger values lighter).  Finally, a
binary scale can be used to show the gross structure of the network by
thresholding the data.
</p>
<p>
The names of the gray matter regions are shown along the border, and
hovering over a cell will show its corresponding metric value and connecting
region names.  The cells may be reordered lexicographically by region name or
numerically by the column sum, min or max of the connectivity metric.
